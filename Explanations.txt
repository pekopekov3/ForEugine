Some explanations:

1. The folder SoapEaxampleService, contains eclipse project SAOPExample, which is a web service running on Apache Tomcat 8.0
The WSDL file can be viewed through browser at http://localhost:8080/SOAPExample/services/PersonServiceImpl?wsdl also it is
Located WebContent\wsdl folder.
2. The folder CustomConnector contains the Mule devKit project T24Outbound (don't let this name fool you, it is just a test to the exposed service above)
this connector can exchange data with the PersonServiceImpl service. It is pretty straight-forward simple CXF connector. 
3. The folder SimpleMuleFlow is an AnyPoint Studio Project That uses the above connector as outbound connector at the end of the flow.
It takes file with simple JSON data as an input, converts it to Object and sends the object through the connector to the PersonSrviceImpl.
